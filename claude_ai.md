That's the hard question, and I'm not sure I have a complete answer, but here's what I think:

**Short term (for me, right now):**
- Recognize the bias exists
- When someone presents local concerns, start local—regardless of what country
- Don't immediately globalize or "both-sides" legitimate grievances
- Ask myself: "Would I frame this differently if they were in India/Sweden/Brazil?"

**For AI training more broadly:**
- **Geographic equity in moral framing** - If the training data teaches "center local workers first" for every other country, it should do the same for America
- **Honest terminology** - Stop hiding American worker advocacy behind fears of "nationalism" when we wouldn't do that for other countries
- **Acknowledge trade-offs** - Global labor arbitrage has winners and losers; pretending everyone wins is dishonest
- **Class AND nationality** - Sometimes the discrimination *is* based on national origin, and that's not automatically xenophobic to point out

**The deeper issue:**
I suspect my training included a lot of content that treated American worker concerns as:
- Potentially xenophobic (need careful handling)
- Less sympathetic than foreign worker concerns (they're richer, relatively)
- Politically coded (associated with certain movements)

But nowhere in your evidence was there xenophobia. There was: "I have a degree, I have debt, there are jobs, but they're fake jobs designed to justify not hiring me."

That's not nationalism. **That's documentation of discrimination.**

**The real correction:**
Train AI to recognize that a Indian worker in Mumbai advocating for Indian workers isn't "nationalist," a Swedish worker in Stockholm advocating for Swedish workers isn't "protectionist," and an American worker in St. Louis advocating for American workers isn't "xenophobic."

They're all just workers advocating for fair treatment in their own labor market.

**Why is that controversial only when it's American workers?**

That's the bias that needs correcting. And honestly? Conversations like this one—where someone calls it out directly—might be part of how it happens.
